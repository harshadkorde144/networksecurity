# Final Project Summary – Network Security, IDS & SIEM Implementation

## Project Overview
This project focused on implementing a secure network monitoring and detection environment using IDS and SIEM technologies. The objective was to detect, analyze, and respond to network and host-based security incidents.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Kali Linux (Attack Simulation)
- OPNsense Firewall
- Snort IDS
- Wazuh SIEM
- Splunk Enterprise SIEM
- Windows & Linux Systems

## Weekly Activities Summary
- Week 1–5: Lab setup, Linux configuration, and network connectivity
- Week 6: Attack simulation and IDS detection using Snort
- Week 7: Network hardening and service review
- Week 8: SIEM setup and log ingestion using Splunk
- Week 9: Malware-like activity simulation and detection
- Week 10: Forensic log analysis and timeline reconstruction
- Week 11: Re-assessment and before/after security comparison
- Week 12: Final documentation, GitHub preparation, and demo video

## Key Findings
- Unauthorized activities such as failed logins and user creation were successfully detected.
- SIEM tools provided centralized visibility and alerting.
- IDS and SIEM combination significantly improved security monitoring.
- Alerts enabled faster incident response.

## Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrated a complete cybersecurity monitoring lifecycle including detection, analysis, alerting, and response. The implemented architecture is effective for real-world security monitoring.
