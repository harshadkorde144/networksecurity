# Week 1: Setting Up the Virtual Network Lab

## Goal
The main aim of this week is to establish a small internal network using OPNsense as a firewall/router along with Kali Linux and Ubuntu virtual machines. The focus is on ensuring that devices can communicate with the OPNsense LAN interface and receive IP addresses automatically through DHCP.

## Virtual Machines Overview
| VM Name  | Network Adapter 1 | Network Adapter 2 (Optional) |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------------------|
| OPNsense | Internal Network | NAT for Internet access    |
| Kali     | Internal Network | NAT (if needed)            |
| Ubuntu   | Internal Network | NAT (if needed)            |

> Note: All VMs connected to the internal network can communicate with each other.  

## Network Configuration Details
- **LAN Interface (em0)** on OPNsense: 192.168.1.1/24  
- **WAN Interface (em1)** on OPNsense: gets IP via DHCP from NAT (example: 10.0.3.x)  
- **DHCP Range for LAN clients**: 192.168.1.10 – 192.168.1.100  
- **Default Gateway**: 192.168.1.1  
- **DNS Server**: 8.8.8.8  

## Verification
- Kali Linux obtained an IP automatically from the LAN DHCP server (example: 192.168.1.100).  
- Ping test from Kali to OPNsense LAN gateway is successful (`ping 192.168.1.1`).  

## Screenshots to Include
1. **OPNsense Dashboard** – Shows LAN and WAN IP addresses.  
2. **LAN DHCP Settings** – Screenshots of DHCP configuration page.  
3. **Kali Terminal** – Displaying the obtained IP address and ping test results.  =

---

**Summary:**  
By the end of Week 1, the internal network is functional. OPNsense is running as the LAN gateway and DHCP server, and Kali Linux is able to communicate within the network. This setup forms the foundation for all the upcoming lab exercises.


# Week 2 — Network Scanning & Mapping (Nmap)

## Objective
Perform network discovery and service enumeration on the lab's internal network to build a baseline of live hosts, open ports and running services. These results will be used later for IDS/firewall testing and documentation.

---

## Environment
- **OPNsense (LAN gateway):** 192.168.1.1  
- **Kali Linux (scanner):** 192.168.1.10  
- **Subnet:** 192.168.1.0/24  
- **Tool:** nmap (Kali Linux)

---

## Exact commands executed
Run these on the Kali VM. Outputs were saved under `Week2/scans/`.

```bash
# 1) Discover live hosts on the LAN
sudo nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24 -oN Week2/scans/lan_ping_scan.nmap

# 2) Enumerate services and versions on discovered hosts (save text + xml + gnmap)
sudo nmap -sV 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.10 -oA Week2/scans/lan_service_scan 
```
#  Week 3 – Firewall Configuration & Traffic Filtering (OPNsense)

## Objective
In this week, the goal was to configure firewall security rules in **OPNsense** to monitor and block malicious traffic, set up network aliases, and test firewall protection using **Kali Linux**.

---

## 🧩 Steps Performed

### 1. OPNsense Dashboard Overview
- Verified that both LAN (`192.168.1.1/24`) and WAN (`10.0.3.x`) interfaces were configured correctly.
- Ensured LAN connection with the Kali VM using internal network mode.

📷 **Screenshot:** `1_dashboard.png`

---

### 2. Created Aliases
- Added aliases to simplify firewall rule management:
  - **SUS_IPS:** Suspicious host IPs (e.g., `10.0.2.99`)
  - **SUS_PORTS:** Common suspicious ports (`23, 445, 3389`)
  - **Internal_LAN:** Internal network range (`192.168.1.0/24`)

📷 **Screenshot:** `2_aliases.png`

---

### 3. Configured Firewall Rules (LAN)
- Added rules to **block** suspicious hosts and ports.
- Rule Order:
  1. Block traffic from `SUS_IPS` to `LAN net`
  2. Block suspicious ports (`SUS_PORTS`)
  3. Allow remaining LAN to any (default rule)

📷 **Screenshot:** `3_rules_lan.png`  
📷 **Screenshot:** `4_rule_edit.png`

---

### 4. Performed Network Scanning
- Used **Nmap** from Kali to test firewall detection and filtering:
  ```bash
  sudo nmap 192.168.1.1
-Verified open ports (22, 53, 443) and confirmed blocked access as per rules.

📷 **Screenshot:** `5_nmap_scan.png`

---

### 5. Checked Firewall Logs

  1. Viewed logs under Firewall → Log Files → Live View.

  2. Confirmed blocked traffic attempts and verified rule actions.

✅ WEEK-5 – Intrusion Detection System using Snort (README.md Complete)
# WEEK-5 – Intrusion Detection System using Snort

This practical demonstrates how to install, configure, and run **Snort IDS** to detect suspicious activities such as **ICMP ping probes** and **Nmap SYN scans**.  
We created custom rules in `local.rules` and verified alerts in real time.

---

## 📌 1. Environment Setup

### **Snort Version**
Snort++ 3.9.x running on Kali Linux (VirtualBox NAT/Bridge).

### **Network Interface**
Snort is listening on:


eth0 – 192.168.1.10/24


---

## 📌 2. Snort Configuration Changes

### Updated `/etc/snort/snort.lua`

RULE_PATH = "/etc/snort/rules"

ips =
{
    variables = default_variables,

    rules =
    {
        RULE_PATH .. "/local.rules"
    }
}


✔ This ensures Snort loads our custom rules.

📌 3. Custom Rules (local.rules)

Path:

/etc/snort/rules/local.rules

Added Rules:
alert icmp any any -> any any (
    msg:"ICMP Ping Detected";
    sid:100001;
    gid:1;
)

alert tcp any any -> any any (
    msg:"Possible Nmap SYN Scan";
    flags:S;
    sid:100002;
    gid:1;
)


✔ First rule detects ICMP echo requests
✔ Second rule detects TCP SYN scans (used by Nmap)

📌 4. Validate Snort Configuration

Command:

sudo snort -T -c /etc/snort/snort.lua


Expected Output:

Snort successfully validated the configuration

📌 5. Running Snort in IDS Mode

Command:

sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.lua -i eth0 -A alert_fast


✔ Snort starts listening on eth0
✔ Shows “Commencing packet processing”

📌 6. Attack Simulation & Alerts
✅ A) ICMP Ping Test

Command:

ping -c 3 192.168.1.1


Expected Snort Alert:

[**] [1:100001:1] ICMP Ping Detected


📸 Screenshot:
